        /* Debouncing
        Some types of events have the potential to fire rapidly many times in a 
        row, such as the "mousemove" and "scroll" events. When handling such 
        events, you must be careful not to do anything too time-consuming or 
        your handler will take up so much time that interaction with the 
        document starts to feel slow.
        If you do need to do something nontrivial in such a handler, you can 
        use setTimeout to make sure you are not doing it too often. 
        This is usually called debouncing the event. 
        There are several slightly different approaches to this.
        */
        /* For example, suppose we want to react when the user has typed 
        something, but we don’t want to do it immediately for every input event. 
        When they are typing quickly, we just want to wait until a pause occurs. 
        Instead of immediately performing an action in the event handler, we set
         a timeout. We also clear the previous timeout (if any) so that when 
         events occur close together (closer than our timeout delay), 
         the timeout from the previous event will be canceled.
        Giving an undefined value to clearTimeout or calling it on a timeout 
        that has already fired has no effect. Thus, we don’t have to be careful
         about when to call it, and we simply do so for every event.
        */
        let textarea = document.querySelector("textarea");
        let timeout;
        textarea.addEventListener("input", () => {
            clearTimeout(timeout);
            timeout = setTimeout(() => console.log("Typed!"), 500);
        });

        /* We can use a slightly different pattern if we want to space responses
         so that they’re separated by at least a certain length of time but want
        to fire them during a series of events, not just afterward. 
        For example, we might want to respond to "mousemove" events by showing
        the current coordinates of the mouse, but only every 250 milliseconds.*/

        let scheduled = null;
        window.addEventListener("mousemove", event => {
          if (!scheduled) {
            setTimeout(() => {
                para.textContent =
                `Mouse at ${scheduled.pageX}, ${scheduled.pageY}`;
              scheduled = null;
            }, 250);
          }
          scheduled = event;
