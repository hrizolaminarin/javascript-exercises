      let element = document.getElementById("example");

      // displays even hidden text
      console.log(element.textContent); // Output: Hello world!
      // considers style so doesn't show hidden text
      console.log(element.innerText); // Output: Hello !

      /* - innerText is aware of CSS. So if you have hidden text innerText 
      ignores this text, whereas textContent will not
- Because innerText cares about CSS it will trigger a reflow, whereas textContent will not
- innerText ignores the Text nodes contained in <script> and <style> elements
- innerText, unlike textContent will normalize the text that is returned. Just
  think of textContent as returning exactly what is in the document with the
  markup removed.
  This will include white space, line breaks, and carriage returns
- innerText is considered to be non-standard and browser specific while 
textContent is implemented from the DOM specifications*/
