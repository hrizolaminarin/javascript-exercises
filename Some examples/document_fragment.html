      /*You might wonder what is the advantage to using a documentFragment over 
      simply creating (via createElement()) a <div> in memory and working within 
        this <div> to create a DOM structure. The follow are the differences.

        - A document fragment may contain any kind of node (except <body> or
        <html>)  where as an element may not
        - The document fragment itself, is not added to the DOM when you append a fragment. 
        The contents of the node are. As opposed to appending an element node in which 
        the element itself is part of the appending.
        - When a document fragment is appended to the DOM it transfers from the
          document fragment to the place its appended. Its no longer in memory
          in the place you created it. This is not true for element nodes that 
          are temperately used to contained nodes briefly and then are moved to
          the live DOM.*/
